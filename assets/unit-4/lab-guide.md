# Guided Lab · Threat Hunting & Incident Containment

This lab simulates multi-stage attacks targeting sensitive datasets.

- **Phase 1:** Perform log enrichment and anomaly detection using supplied SIEM queries.
- **Phase 2:** Execute containment drills (isolation, credential resets, segmentation) in a sandboxed environment.
- **Phase 3:** Draft breach notifications aligned with DPDP timelines and cross-border reporting obligations.
- **Phase 4:** Implement data-centric mitigations such as tokenisation, format-preserving encryption, and DLP tuning.

Document key lessons in the worksheet and prep for the debrief discussion prompts.
