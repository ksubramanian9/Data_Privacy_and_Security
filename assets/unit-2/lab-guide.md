# Guided Lab · Implementing Authenticated Encryption

This lab positions students to configure, benchmark, and harden authenticated encryption.

- **Environment:** Containerised services with TLS termination and message queue workloads.
- **Exercise:** Implement AES-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305, and a post-quantum KEM prototype; capture performance metrics.
- **Validation:** Run supplied unit tests to confirm integrity, replay protection, and key rotation alerts.
- **Extension:** Apply envelope encryption to protect data lake snapshots and document residual risks.

Use the lab artefacts to reinforce the worksheet reflections and case study deliverable.
