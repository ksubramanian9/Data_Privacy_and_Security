Analyse "VeloxPay", a real-time payments start-up balancing strong cryptography with low latency requirements.

- Compare symmetric, asymmetric, and hybrid encryption stacks for API traffic and settlement records.
- Evaluate readiness for post-quantum algorithms, including migration strategies and hardware dependencies.
- Produce an operations memo recommending key management rotations, HSM deployment, and compliance evidence.

Learners collaborate in pairs to critique trade-offs and defend their recommendation to a mock change advisory board.
