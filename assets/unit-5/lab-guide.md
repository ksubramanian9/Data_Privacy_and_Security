# Guided Lab · Federated Analytics Studio

This lab helps learners orchestrate a privacy-preserving analytics pipeline.

- **Step 1:** Configure a simulated consortium with regional data nodes and shared governance policies.
- **Step 2:** Implement secure aggregation with differential privacy noise controls and monitor privacy budget burn-down.
- **Step 3:** Deploy a confidential computing enclave to evaluate model inference latency and trust guarantees.
- **Step 4:** Automate reporting for NIST AI RMF Govern/Manage functions and ISO/IEC 42001 checkpoints.

Capture lab artefacts as evidence for assessments and stakeholder briefings.
