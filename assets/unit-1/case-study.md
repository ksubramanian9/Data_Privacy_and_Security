# Case Study · Building a Privacy Governance Dossier

This case study profiles "Nimbus Mobility", a pan-India mobility platform responding to overlapping privacy mandates. The case walks learners through:

- Mapping cross-border data flows and data fiduciary obligations under the DPDP Act 2023.
- Harmonising GDPR, CPRA, and CERT-In incident handling requirements for shared telemetry pipelines.
- Presenting a board-ready governance dossier that evidences CIA controls, differential privacy analytics, and responsible AI usage.

Facilitators can assign teams to prepare a 15-minute briefing that prioritises remediation backlogs and stakeholder communication plans.
