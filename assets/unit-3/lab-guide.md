# Guided Lab · Hardening Access Journeys

This lab focuses on instrumenting and testing adaptive authentication.

- **Lab Setup:** Provision a demo identity provider with passkey support and risk-based policies.
- **Scenario 1:** Configure phishing-resistant authentication and verify enforcement through simulated attacks.
- **Scenario 2:** Implement just-in-time access elevation with granular logging and approvals.
- **Scenario 3:** Analyse audit logs to detect anomalies, then tune alert thresholds.

Capture findings in the worksheet and prepare evidence for the discussion prompts.
