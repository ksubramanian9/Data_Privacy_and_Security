      <h2>Unit Overview</h2>
      <p>This unit anchors the programme with a governance-first mindset. You will catalogue the data your organisation touches, align controls with privacy commitments, and translate the CIA Triad into practical guardrails that protect stakeholder trust.</p>
      <p>We begin by comparing major regulations&mdash;from the GDPR and India&rsquo;s Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act 2023 to the CCPA/CPRA, LGPD, and emerging AI governance charters&mdash;so you can map shared principles, divergent obligations, and localisation needs. Alongside this comparative view, you will practice privacy threat modelling that traces adversarial goals against data assets, and engineer data subject rights journeys that scale across channels and jurisdictions.</p>
